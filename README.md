# MBC-app

MBC-app is a **work in process** mobile application for a beer company developed in React Native [![ReactNative](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=react)](https://skills.thijs.gg).

## Installation

Use the package manager npm install to install MBC-App.

At the moment it is only adapted to run on Android devices, but soon IOS will be added.

```bash
npm install

npx react-native start
```

## Profiles
If the profile recieved from the server is administrator, the app will automatically render the administrator view. In this view the user can only scan and validate coupons.

The normal user will get an advertisement the first time it opens the app and will have the full functionalities of the app.
